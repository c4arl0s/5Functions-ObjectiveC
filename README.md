# 5Functions-ObjectiveC
A function is a name associated with a chunk of code. 

# When should I use a function?

# How do I write and use a function?

# How functions work together

# Local variables, frames, and the stack

# Recursion

# Looking at the frames in the debugger

# return

When you return 0 to the system, you are saying “Everything went OK.” If you are terminating the program because something has gone wrong, you’ll return 1.

# Global and static variables

- Global variables are available to the code in every one of those files.
- A static variable is like a global variable in that it is declared outside of any function.
